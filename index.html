        <p>My name is Julien (SleepyCloud is my pseudo), and this is my GitHub Page. A big fan of video games and computers since a young age,

            <p>This is a Reign-like game where you play as a CEO of an international tech company. 
                <br>You have to make choices that will influence the future of your company, based on 4 criteria. The particularity of this game is that you have acces to an AI button. 
                <br>When you press it, an AI will give you the best choice to do and you can decide if you want to follow it or not.
                <br><br>Here is a video of the game :</p>

            <h3>Horizon</h3>
            <p>This is an online exchange platform for students, allowing them to get quick answers to their questions through a collaborative forum/ticketing system (instead of emails), to create content, or to share documents, articles, or events.
                <br>The idea comes from a recently established student support association at EFREI Paris. Its goal is to assist students in their academic success and to initiate collaborative projects for students</p>
