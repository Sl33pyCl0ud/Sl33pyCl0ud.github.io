        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Julien (SleepyCloud is my pseudo :) ), and this is my GitHub Page. A big fan of video games and computers since a young age, 
            I hope to be able to develop myself in this field and try to store my future projects here, which I hope will be numerous. 	&#x1F642; </p>

            <h3>Horizon</h3>
            <p>This is an online exchange platform for students, allowing them to get quick answers to their questions through a collaborative forum/ticketing system (instead of emails), to create content, or to share documents, articles, or events.
                <br>The idea comes from a recently established student support association at EFREI Paris. Its goal is to assist students in their academic success and to initiate collaborative projects for students</p>
